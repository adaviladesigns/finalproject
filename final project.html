<p> I grew up in Washington Heights, New York City. I lived with my mom and two older siblings. Being biracial, Italian, and Honduran /Afro Hispanic, I grew up in a very blended family. Food always brought us together. Growing up in New York City was interesting, always surrounded by so many beautiful cultures and traditions. </p>
